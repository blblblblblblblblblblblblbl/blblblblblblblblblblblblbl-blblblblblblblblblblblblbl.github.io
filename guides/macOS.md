First of all, go on this [page](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Newcord), click on the download button and save the file wherever you want ( In the downloads folder for example. What matters is that you can find it ).

Then, you need to go to the Themes tab of BetterDiscord and click on "Open Themes Folder" to access the themes folder.

Once it's done, open the folder where you placed the file in another window and place it in the themes folder.
